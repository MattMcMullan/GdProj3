Gerald, please make these:

-HUD Sprites (Ball, Trap1, Trap2)
-Menu Buttons (Start, Instructions, Options, Exit)
-HUD Backgrounds (think TF2 behind the numbers)
--Text is cyan, so consider that when making the backgrounds.

Please make the HUD sprites as a square .png file.

We also need some planes in Maya... I think.  The plane used for the icons currently seems to be a square.  So, we need planes in the same shape as the buttons and backgrounds.

Also, please make sure to include transparency.

You can delete this file once all tasks are complete.
